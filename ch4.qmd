Richard Levins (1930-2016). Born in Brooklyn, New York, he studied agriculture and mathematics at Cornell. Early on, influenced by geneticist and polymath Haldane, he became a Marxist activist. Upon graduation, having been blacklisted as a communist (and with the Korean War raging), he moved to Puerto Rico with his wife, and set up a farm. In his spare time, he conducted experiments on fruit flies, organized anti-colonialist rallies and anti-war protests, and taught at the University of Puerto Rico. In 1964, he was invited to Cuba to help organize the biology department of the University of Havana. He received his doctorate from Columbia University in 1965. In 1967 he moved to the University of Chicago, where he joined Richard Lewontin---whith whom he established a lifelong collaboration. They both moved to Harvard in the late 1970s.

It is impossible to summarize his numerous contributions to ecology, mathematics, political science, and the philosophy of science. He has inspired countless ecologists, and his approach and style are still visible in many of the research programs being carried out today. Of particular interest for this class, his theory of evolution in a changing environment (Levins (1968)), the development of the idea of limiting similarity (MacArthur and Levins (1967)), his work on metapopulation dynamics (Levins (1969)), and the development of Loop Analysis (i.e., a qualitative theory for dynamical systems, Puccia and Levins (2013)).

## Metapopulations

In 1969, Richard Levins---then a professor at U. Chicagoâ€”proposed a simple model for a "metapopulation", i.e., a "population of populations in which local extinctions are balanced by remigration from other populations" (Levins (1969)).

The model is very simple. Suppose that there are very many patches of suitable habitat, and that we track the proportion of patches occupied by a certain species, $p(t)$. Two processes affect the proportion of occupied patches: extinction, turning an occupied patch into a vacant patch, and colonization, turning a vacant patch into an occupied patch. For the simplest case, suppose that occupied patches can send "propagules" to empty patches at a fixed rate $\gamma > 0$, and that the rate at which local populations go extinct is the same for all patches, $\delta > 0$.

Call $q(t) = 1-p(t)$ the proportion of vacant patches. Then, the dynamics are described by the equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{p}(t) = -\delta p(t) + \gamma p(t)q(t)\\
\dot{q}(t) = \delta p(t) - \gamma p(t)q(t)\\
\end{cases}
$$

in which we assume mass-action (like in GLV). Note that the two equations sum to zero (i.e., we're in a zero-sum setting), and therefore we can substitute $q(t) = 1-p(t)$ to obtain:

$$
\dot{p} = p(-\delta + \gamma q) = p(\gamma - \delta - \gamma p)
$$

which is the usual equation for the logistic growth, with growth rate $\gamma - \delta$ and self-interaction $\gamma$. As such, as long as $\gamma > \delta$, the proportion of inhabited patches will converge to $p^\star = 1 - \delta/\gamma > 0$, which is globally stable.

## Colonization-competition tradeoff

Levins' model was extended in a number of ways. One of the most interesting cases is that in which we have $n$ species, each characterized by an extinction and a colonization rate, and there is a trade-off such that better colonizers are worse competitors, and vice versa. In particular:

- $p_i$ is the proportion of patches occupied by population $i$, with $\sum_j p_j \leq 1$
- $m_i$ is the extinction rate for population $i$
- $c_i$ is the colonization rate for population $i$ 
- each species can colonize patches occupied by inferior competitors (i.e., these patches "look" empty to them)
- competitive abilities are inversely correlated with colonization rates, i.e., if $c_j < c_i$, then $j$ is a superior competitor

The model is a system of $n$ coupled differential equations:

$$
\dot{p}_i = -m_i p_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} c_j p_j p_i + c_i p_i \left(1-\sum_{j=1}^{i} p_j\right)
$$

There are three processes at play:

- $-m_i p_i$ the rate at which patches occupied by $i$ become empty
- $c_j p_j p_i$ propagules from superior competitors $j$ (produced at rate $c_j p_j$) reach patches occupied by $i$ and turn them over
- propagules of $i$, produced at rate $c_i p_i$, reach patches that are either empty or occupied by inferior competitors (written as the difference between $1$ and the sum of the proportion of patches occupied by species with equal or better competitive abilities, $1-\sum_{j=1}^{i} p_j$) and colonize them

## The model is GLV

With some rearranging, we can write this model as GLV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{p}_i &= p_i\left(-m_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} c_j p_j + c_i \left(1-\sum_{j=1}^{i} p_j\right)\right)\\
&= p_i\left(-m_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} c_j p_j + c_i - c_i p_i -\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} c_i p_j \right)\\
&= p_i\left(c_i -m_i - c_i p_i -\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (c_i + c_j) p_j \right)\\
&= p_i\left(r_i - \sum_{j}A_{ij} p_j\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
Where we have defined the matrix $A$:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
c_1 & 0 & 0 &\cdots &0\\
c_1 + c_2 & c_2 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
c_1 + c_3 & c_2 + c_3 & c_3 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
c_1 + c_n & c_2 + c_n & c_3 + c_n & \cdots & c_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$

and $r_i = c_i - m_i$.

We want to show that for each initial set of species in the system, dynamics will converge to a unique saturated equilibrium.

To prove this, it is sufficient to find a positive diagonal matrix, $D(w)$ such that

$$
M = D(w) A + A^T D(w)
$$

is positive definite. Take $w = c^{-1}$ (i.e., the reciprocals of the colonization rates). Then we have that 

$$
M = 1_n 1_n^T + Q
$$

Where 

$$
Q_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 \quad \text{if}\; j = i\\
\frac{c_i}{c_j} \quad \text{if}\; j > i\\
\frac{c_j}{c_i} \quad \text{if}\; j < i\\
\end{cases}
$$

To show that $M$ is positive definite, we write the Cholesky decomposition of $Q$

$$
Q = R^T R
$$

With

$$
R_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{\sqrt{c_i^2 - c_{i-1}^2}}{c_j}  \quad \text{if}\; j \geq i\\
0 \quad \text{if}\; j < i\\
\end{cases}
$$

(defining $c_0 = 0$). Note that all the elements of $R_{ij} \geq 0$. As such, $Q$ is positive (semi-)definite, and $M$ is the sum of two positive (semi-)definite matrices, and is thus positive (semi-)definite. 

An example. Suppose $n = 3$, then:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
c_1 & 0 & 0\\
c_1 + c_2 & c_2 & 0\\
c_1 + c_3 & c_2 + c_3 & c_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$$
M = D(c)^{-1} A + A^T D(c)^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 + \frac{c_1}{c_2} & 1 + \frac{c_1}{c_3}\\
1 + \frac{c_1}{c_2} &2 & 1 + \frac{c_2}{c_3}\\
1 + \frac{c_1}{c_3} & 1 + \frac{c_2}{c_3} & 2\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$$
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & \frac{c_1}{c_2} & \frac{c_1}{c_3}\\
\frac{c_1}{c_2} & 1 & \frac{c_2}{c_3}\\
\frac{c_1}{c_3} & \frac{c_2}{c_3} & 1\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$$
R = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & \frac{c_1}{c_2} & \frac{c_1}{c_3}\\
0 & \frac{c_2^2 - c_1^2}{c_2} & \frac{c_2^2 - c_1^2}{c_3}\\
0 & 0 & \frac{c_3^2 - c_2^2}{c_3}
\end{pmatrix} \quad Q = R^T R
$$

## Computing equilibria

For simplicity, we are going to consider the case in which $m_i = m$ for all $i$. Because the matrix is lower-triangular, computing the equilibrium is especially simple, because each the value of each species depends only on those of the preceding species. The equilibrium of the first species is given by:

$$
c_1 p_1 = c_1 -m
$$

and thus 

$$
p_1^\star = \frac{c_1 - m}{c_1} = 1 - \frac{m}{c_1}
$$

The first species follows the Levins' model, and persists as long as $c_1 > m$. We compute the equilibrium for the second species, assuming that the first species is present:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(c_1 + c_2) p_1^\star + c_2 p_2^\star = c_2 - m\\
(c_1 + c_2)\left(1 - \frac{m}{c_1}\right) + c_2 p_2^\star &=  c_2 - m\\
c_1 + c_2 - m - m \frac{c_2}{c_1} +  c_2 p_2^\star &=  c_2 - m\\
p_2^\star = \frac{m}{c_1} - \frac{c_1}{c_2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, species 2 can establish if:

$$
c_2 > \frac{c_1^2}{m}
$$

Computing the equilibrium of the third species we find that it is positive if:

$$
c_3 > \frac{c_2^2}{\frac{c_1^2}{m}}
$$

You can see that there is a simple pattern. Call $l_0 = m$, then the condition for the first species to persist is that $c_1 > l_0$; second species to persist whenever $c_2 > c_1^2 / l_0 = l_1$; the third species persists whenever $c_3 > c_2^2 / l_1$, and so forth:

$$
l_i = \frac{c_i^2}{l_{i-1}}
$$

This value represents the "shadow" each species that establishes casts on the colonization axis. A worse competitor $i + 1$ can establish if and only if:

$$
c_{i+1} > l_i
$$

Thus, if the species has a sufficiently large colonization rate, it will establish; if not, it will go extinct. In this way, we can compute the set of coexisting species in *linear time* (i.e., without the need to invert the matrix). 

## Random parameters

Sample the colonization rate values from a distribution (with positive support); for example $\gamma_i \sim \mathcal U[0,1]$. Then sort them and assign the smallest value to species 1, the second smallest value to species 2, etc. These are called the *order statistics* of the distribution.

How many species will coexist?
