## All species growing logistically

Suppose we take $n$ populations, each growing according to:

$$
\dot{x}_i = x_i (r_i - A_{ii} x_i)
$$

with $A_{ii} > 0$. We assume that $r_i \sim Q$, a distribution with mean $0$, $\matbb E(r_i) = 0$ and symmetric about its mean $P(r_i) = P(-r_i)$. For example, we could choose $r_i \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$, or $r_i \sim \mathcal U[-1, 1]$. Naturally, whenever $r_i > 0$, the population will grow to $x_i^\star = r_i / A_{ii}$. If $r_i < 0$, on the other hand, the population will go extinct. Because of the symmetry around zero, each population has therefore probability $1/2$ of persisting. When we have $n$ populations, the number of coexisting populations is a random variable following the binomial distribution:

$$
P(k | n) = \binom{n}{k} \frac{1}{2^n}\quad k \sim \mathcal B\left(n, \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

## The random zoo

Now consider a GLV model with random parameters. We choose $r_i$ from a distribution with mean zero and symmetric about the mean, and each interaction $A_{ij}$ from a distribution with mean zero and symmetric about the mean. Moreover, we add a constant to the diagonal of the matrix such that the symmetric part of $A$, $H(A) = \frac{1}{2} (A + A^T)$ is positive definite. As we have seen before, this means that dynamics will always converge to a saturated equilibrium. 

We now introduce a family of $2^n$ matrices $S_i$, with:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_1 &= \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots &\cdots &\cdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &1
\end{pmatrix} = I_n\\
S_2 &= \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots &\cdots &\cdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &1
\end{pmatrix} \\
S_3 &= \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots &\cdots &\cdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &1
\end{pmatrix} \\
S_4 &= \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots &\cdots &\cdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &1
\end{pmatrix}\\
\cdots\\
S_{2^n} &= \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1 & \cdots & 0\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots &\cdots &\cdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &-1
\end{pmatrix} = -I_n\\
\end{aligned}
$$

These matrices, called *signature matrices* are their own inverse (called *involutory* matrix), and therefore, we have that $S_i S_i = S_i^2 = I_n$. Geometrically, they represent a reflection in each of the axes corresponding to the negated rows or columns.

We then consider what happens when we transform the parameters by multiplying them by $S_i$. Take an arbitrary GLV system, and solve for the $x$ that makes $r + Ax = 0_n$:

$$
x = -A^{-1} r
$$

The vector is a feasible equilibrium for the system if $x > 0_n$. Now consider the transformed system:

$$
r' = S_i r \quad A' = S_iAS_i
$$

Note that $A'$ is similar to $A$, and therefore has the same eigenvalues; moreover, $P(r') = P(r)$ and $P(A') = P(A)$, because of symmetry. Now compute the new solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
x' &= -(S_iAS_i)^{-1} S_i r\\ &=-S_iA^{-1}S_i S_i r\\
&=-S_iA^{-1}r\\
&=-S_i x
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, the transformation changes the sign of the components of $x$ corresponding to the negative coefficients in $S_i$. Hence, for any possible choice of $r$, $A$, there is only one possible choice of $S_i$ that makes the equilibrium feasible. Because all matrices $A'$ and all vectors $r'$ have the same probability/density, then the probability of having a positive $x$ is exactly $1/2^n$. 

Thus, systems with random interactions and a strongly stable matrix of interactions have the same probability of feasibility as that of a system in which populations are not interacting!

The same calculation can be repeated for the case in which we a certain set of $k$ components of $x$ to be positive, in which case the probability is $1/2^k$. We now compute the probability that the remaining $n-k$ populations cannot invade when rare.

We have a set of $k$  populations resting at a feasible equilibrium:

$$
x^{(k)} = -(A^{(k)})^{-1}r^{(k)}
$$

The invasion growth rate for the remaining $n-k$ populations is:

$$
\dot{\log (x^{(n-k)})} = r^{(n-k)} - A^{(n-k,k)}x^{(k)}
$$

Take the family of signature matrices of size $n-k$:

$$
r^{(n-k)'} = S_i r^{(n-k)}\quad A^{(n-k, k)'} = S_i A^{A^{(n-k, k)}}
$$

## Random zoo and experimental data

## Competitive GLV

We now consider a more complicated case, in which we have a competitive GLV system:

$$
\dot{x}_i=x_i r_i (1-\sum_j M_{ij}x_j)
$$

where the matrix of interactions is given by the sum of two matrices:

$$
M = \alpha I + B
$$
and $B$ is a random matrix, with entries sampled independently from a distribution with mean $\mu > 0$, and unit variance. We want to calculate the probability that the system has a feasible equilibrium, and how the probability changes when we increase $\alpha$. 

The value of $\alpha$ can be considered the "excess" intraspecific interaction in the system. To show that this value influences feasibility, we start by showing that a sufficiently large $\alpha$ guarantees feasibility.

## A sufficiently large $\alpha$ guarantees feasibility

We want to show that the system of equations

$$
(\alpha I + B)x = 1_n
$$

has a positive solution $x$ for $\alpha$ large enough. To this end, we first divide

Volterra considered many variations, including the competition between species. His results caught the eye of an experimentalist, who validated the principle of competitive exclusion using protozoans:
