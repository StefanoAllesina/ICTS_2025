The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model was discovered independently by Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra:

- Alfred J. Lotka, 1920. [*Analytical Note on Certain Rhythmic Relations in Organic Systems*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.6.7.410). PNAS 6 (7) 410-415

- Vito Volterra, 1926. [*Fluctuations in the Abundance of a Species Considered Mathematically*](https://www.nature.com/articles/118558a0). Nature 118:558-60

The constant of motion was derived by Lotka in 1920:

- Alfred J. Lotka, 1920. [*Undamped oscillations derived from the law of mass action*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja01453a010). Journal of the American Chemical Society 42:1595-1599

Volterra considered many variations, including the competition between species. His results caught the eye of an experimentalist, who validated the principle of competitive exclusion using protozoans:

- G.F. Gause, 1934. [Experimental Analysis of Vito Volterra's Mathematical Theory of the Struggle for Existence](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.79.2036.16.b). Science 79:16-17

The analysis of two-species competitive Lotka-Volterra inspired the so-called Modern Coexistence Theory:
