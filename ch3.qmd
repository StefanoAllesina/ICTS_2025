## Experiments in which different combinations of species are grown together

For this exploration, we are going to consider a popular experiment in which different combinations of species from a pool are co-cultured. In many cases, only the final outcome (i.e., the density of the populations at the end of the experiment) is available/recorded. Typically, the pool of species to experiment with contains only species that can grow in isolation. 

## Example data



## A simple statistical framework

## The structure of equilibria in GLV

## SSQ, WLS, likelihoods

One of the first disease models, proposed by Ronald Ross, who won the Nobel prize for his discovery of malaria transmission via mosquitoes:
